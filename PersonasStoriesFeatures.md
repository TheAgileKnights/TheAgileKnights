# Interviews, Personas, Scenarios, and Stories
## Interview 1
Interviewee Name: Frank
Date: October 10th, 2025

**Question 1: Tell me about how you currently manage your personal expenses and any shared expenses with roommates, friends, or groups.**
**Answer:** I manage expenses mostly through a credit card, and handle shared expenses with friends and roommates mostly through venmo transactions where we just share what is owed.

**Question 2: Walk me through the last time you had to split a bill or shared expense with others. What happened?**
**Answer:** The last time I had to split a bill was at a restaurant, and I paid for the whole table and asked everyone to pay me for their tab afterwards. It was a little confusing remembering who had what and accounting for the tip and tax as well.

**Question 3: What's the most frustrating or awkward situation you've experienced involving money and other people?**
**Answer:** The most awkward situation I’ve had involving money with other people was when I had to text people to ask for payment they had forgotten about from a grocery trip.

**Question 4: How do you keep track of who owes you money or who you owe money to?**
**Answer:** I mostly keep track of it through word of mouth and memory, and just an honor system.

**Question 5: What would make you feel more comfortable asking people to pay you back or reminding them about money they owe?**
**Answer:** Having an easy way to show them exactly what they paid and when would be helpful.

**Question 6: If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about handling expenses (personal or shared), what would it be?**
**Answer:** I would make it easier to itemize what I’ve been buying and keep track of who owes me an exact amount.

**Question 7 (Optional): How much time per week do you spend dealing with expense-related tasks like tracking spending, paying bills, or settling up with people?**
**Answer:** I don’t spend a significant amount of time dealing with those sorts of tasks, and probably don’t audit myself and my spending enough.

### Persona
**Frank, age 22**, is a senior environmental science major at a university in Kentucky. Born in the Philippines, he moved to the United States in 2015 and lived in multiple states before settling in Kentucky for college. His parents work in healthcare in Maryland and maintain business interests in the Philippines. Frank enjoys photography and spending time with friends while still exploring his career options. He manages shared expenses primarily through Venmo but finds it cumbersome to track everything without sending payment requests immediately.

Frank's primary need is an efficient system to track shared costs and settle up with friends without the pressure of requesting payment all at once. As a budget-conscious student, he wants accurate expense tracking that allows him to document costs as they occur and send payment reminders later. He lives with two roommates and frequently organizes group activities, making him responsible for upfront payments that require subsequent reimbursement. His ideal solution would simplify the process of itemizing expenses, calculating fair splits including tax and tip, and managing payment status without awkward follow-ups.

### Scenarios
#### Scenario 1: Weekend Trip Cost Split
Frank and his friends plan a Fall Break trip to Gatlinburg, Tennessee to explore the outdoors and tourism attractions. Frank spots a good cabin rental deal and pays for it upfront, also volunteering to drive the group. Throughout the trip, he tracks expenses he pays out of pocket including the cabin rental, gas, and shared meals. At trip's end, Frank uses KnightWallet to split costs according to what each person owes based on their participation in different activities. He sends payment reminders to friends, allowing them to see exactly what they're being charged for and giving them the option to question any mistakes in item assignment. The system helps Frank maintain his budget awareness while avoiding the social awkwardness of immediately demanding payment for every expense during the vacation.
#### Scenario 2: Utility Bill Payments
Frank lives with two roommates in an apartment where they're billed monthly for water, electricity, and internet based on usage, so amounts vary each month. Frank has his credit card on file to cover these expenses and needs to split the bills with his roommates after invoices arrive. He uses KnightWallet to input the total utility costs, which automatically divides them evenly among the three roommates. His roommates receive notifications when new bills are added so they can pay promptly, and they can view clear breakdowns of the charges to understand what they're paying for. The system tracks who has and hasn't paid, making it easy for Frank to follow up if needed. Roommates can also request adjustments if they were away for part of the month, ensuring fair payment distribution.
#### Scenario 3: Dinner with Friends
Frank and five friends visit a new Mexican restaurant with excellent food. When the check arrives, the server explains they have a single-check policy and cannot split the bill six ways. Frank confidently pays the entire $180 bill and leaves a generous tip for their helpful server. He then uses KnightWallet to input individual meal costs so each person is charged only for what they ordered. The app automatically calculates and splits the tax and tip evenly among the six people, avoiding tedious manual math. Frank sends payment requests with clear totals, allowing friends to pay immediately without rechecking the receipt. The transaction is saved in his history so he can monitor his spending on group outings over time.

## Interview 2
Interviewee Name: Paul
Date: October 10th, 2025

**Question 1: Tell me about how you currently manage your personal expenses and any shared expenses with roommates, friends, or groups.**
**Answer:** I usually just keep track of how much I spent, and then I ask the others, like, when we're on a trip, how much they spend. A friend of mine actually created Google apps where they all logged in their expenses and then had a total at the bottom, and then it just subtracted the difference. But I usually just keep track and ask everybody else to do so. I’ll keep receipts.

**Question 2: Walk me through the last time you had to split a bill or shared expense with others. What happened?**
**Answer:** When I do have shared expenses, I usually try to settle up when the event’s over. If it’s just going out for the evening, I’ll just kind of assume what I’m planning to spend regardless of whether I get it paid back or not.

**Question 3: What's the most frustrating or awkward situation you've experienced involving money and other people?**
**Answer:** Other people not keeping records like me. Because I’ll tell them to scan their thing on an app and they don’t, and then they’ll go, “Well, actually, no, remember I bought this up.” They’re recollecting things, and you don’t want to get in an argument, but to me, if I don’t have the evidence, it didn’t happen.

**Question 4: How do you keep track of who owes you money or who you owe money to**?
**Answer:** Yeah, kind of goes back to the first question. If it’s just out for the evening, I’ll assume what I’m planning to spend and don’t worry too much about it. For bigger things, I try to settle up at the end of the event.

**Question 5: What would make you feel more comfortable asking people to pay you back or reminding them about money they owe?**
**Answer:** It’d be cool if it was automatic—like when you made a purchase on your card, it sent you a notification that went into something to keep track of daily expenses. Then I could just say, “Here’s what I did.” Quicken is a little too complicated for that, and I don’t want to share all my financial stuff with everybody, but it’d be nice if it worked in real time.

**Question 6: If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about handling expenses (personal or shared), what would it be?**
**Answer:** That I wouldn’t have to refer to the IRS. (laughs) But seriously, making it easier to do—it’s a pain to keep track of all that stuff. Sometimes when you’re in the middle of something and just want to enjoy it, you don’t want to always think about ponying up. Maybe having stuff go exactly to a budget automatically would help.

**Question 7 (Optional): How much time per week do you spend dealing with expense-related tasks like tracking spending, paying bills, or settling up with people?**
**Answer:** About an hour a week, maybe one to two hours.

### Persona
**Paul, age 56**, is a parent of four children living in a suburban area. He frequently manages both family expenses and occasional shared costs with friends during social outings and group trips. Paul works in middle management and has moderate technical proficiency—comfortable with smartphones and basic apps but prefers simple, intuitive solutions over complex financial software like Quicken. He values his leisure time and doesn't want financial tracking to interfere with enjoying social experiences.

Paul's primary frustration is the burden of manual record-keeping and the awkwardness of dealing with friends who don't maintain documentation of shared expenses. When disputes arise, his philosophy is clear: without evidence, it didn't happen. He seeks automation that works in real-time without requiring him to share comprehensive financial data with others. His ideal solution would automatically capture card transactions, maintain simple records for shared expenses only, and eliminate the need to constantly think about "ponying up" during social events. He currently spends 1-2 hours weekly on expense-related tasks and views this as excessive.

### Scenarios
#### Scenario 1: Group Trip Expense Settlement
Paul coordinates a weekend ski trip with five friends, using his credit card for the cabin ($1,200), lift tickets ($450), and groceries ($280). He keeps receipts and asks friends to track their expenses. At trip's end, disputes arise when friends claim purchases they never documented. Paul refuses to reimburse unverified expenses, creating tension. The settlement takes over an hour and leaves him frustrated that his diligent record-keeping was undermined by others' poor documentation. He wishes for a system that automatically captures his card transactions and creates clear records without requiring friends to manually log purchases.
#### Scenario 2: Evening Out with Friends
Paul meets four friends for a casual Friday dinner and drinks. He mentally estimates spending $60 but ends up paying $90 after treating the group to appetizers ($45) and buying a drink round ($38). He doesn't track the evening precisely, viewing it as social give-and-take. However, Paul lacks a consistent method for deciding which events deserve tracking versus which don't. He wishes he had a quick way to flag expenses as "personal" or "needs reimbursement" at purchase time so he wouldn't have to reconstruct his intentions later or wonder if he over-absorbed costs.
#### Scenario 3: Using Friend's Google Apps Expense Tracker
Paul's friend creates a shared Google Sheets tracker for a week-long beach vacation with eight people. Paul makes several purchases (parking, group dinner, supplies totaling $305) but forgets to log some immediately because manual entry during vacation feels burdensome. At settlement, friends mention unlogged expenses they "remember" making. Paul questions these claims without documentation, creating tension. Despite having an organized system, poor compliance makes settlement difficult and takes nearly two hours. Paul wishes his card transactions had automatically synced so at least his expenses were complete and verifiable.

### Stories

#### User Stories for Scenario 1: Group Trip Expense Settlement
1. As a trip organizer, I want to automatically capture my card transactions in real-time so that I don't have to manually save receipts or remember what I spent.
2. As a trip participant, I want to categorize my expenses as "shared" and specify which individuals should split the cost so that settlement calculations are accurate.
3. As someone settling accounts, I want to generate a clear expense summary with transaction timestamps so that I can present documented proof to friends.
4. As a user dealing with disputes, I want to distinguish between verified card transactions and unverified claims so that I can fairly evaluate what was actually spent.
5. As someone who values relationships, I want to send automated settlement requests to friends so that I don't have to personally ask for money owed.
#### User Stories for Scenario 2: Evening Out with Friends
1. As a casual spender, I want to quickly flag a purchase as "personal" or "shared" at the time of transaction so that I don't have to decide later whether to seek reimbursement.
2. As someone on a night out, I want to set an expected spending threshold for the evening so that I know upfront whether tracking is necessary.
3. As a user managing social expenses, I want to designate certain events as "no settlement needed" so that the app doesn't include those purchases in reimbursement calculations.
4. As someone balancing generosity with fairness, I want to review my "personal" expenses later and convert them to "shared" if I change my mind so that I have flexibility.
5. As a busy parent, I want to receive a weekly summary showing my spending by category so that I understand my social costs without daily monitoring.
#### User Stories for Scenario 3: Using Friend's Google Apps Expense Tracker
1. As a group vacation participant, I want my card transactions to automatically sync to a shared expense tracker so that I don't have to manually log purchases during activities.
2. As someone managing shared expenses, I want to maintain my own verified transaction history even when others don't participate fully so that my records are always complete.
3. As a privacy-conscious user, I want to share only specific expense transactions with my group so that friends don't see my personal spending.
4. As someone coordinating settlement, I want the system to clearly distinguish between auto-captured transactions and manually entered claims so that I can assess evidence quality.
5. As a user tired of reminders, I want automatic notifications sent to group members when I log a shared expense so that everyone stays informed without me playing enforcer.

## Interview 3
Interviewee Name: Utsav Sapkota  
Date: October 10, 2025

**Question 1: Tell me about how you currently manage your personal expenses and any shared expenses with roommates, friends, or groups.**  
**Answer:** I use my bank app and my phone's Notes to keep track of my money. We don’t really write it down — we just trust each other to pay back.

**Question 2: Walk me through the last time you had to split a bill or shared expense with others. What happened?**  
**Answer:** The Last time I split a bill was at a drive-thru. I was driving, so it made sense for me to pay. Afterwards, everyone sent me what they owed—but one person forgot, so I had to remind him.

**Question 3: What's the most frustrating or awkward situation you've experienced involving money and other people?**  
**Answer:** It’s always awkward when I have to remind someone to pay me back. I don’t want to sound rude or make things weird.

**Question 4: How do you keep track of who owes you money or who you owe money to?**  
**Answer:** I don’t really use an app or anything. I just remember it or talk about it with people. It’s more of a trust system.

**Question 5: What would make you feel more comfortable asking people to pay you back or reminding them about money they owe?**  
**Answer:** If there was a way to clearly show what each person paid for and when, that would make it easier to ask for the money without it feeling awkward.

**Question 6: If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about handling expenses (personal or shared), what would it be?**  
**Answer:** I’d make it simple to see every item I bought and who owes me for what — kind of like an automatic tracker that splits everything for me.**

### Persona
**Utsav Sapkota, age 22**, is a college student who manages personal expenses using his bank app and the Notes app on his phone. He handles shared expenses with friends and roommates through an informal trust system, relying on memory and verbal agreements rather than structured tracking. While comfortable with this casual approach, he finds it awkward to remind people when they forget to pay him back, worrying about sounding rude or creating tension in friendships.

Utsav's primary challenge is the lack of clear documentation when requesting payment. Without written records showing what each person paid for and when, he feels uncomfortable following up on forgotten payments. He frequently pays for group purchases—especially when driving for food runs—and expects friends to reimburse him later. His ideal solution would be an automatic tracker that shows every item purchased and clearly displays who owes what, eliminating the social awkwardness of payment reminders by providing objective evidence of shared expenses.
### Scenarios
#### Scenario 1: Drive-Thru Payment and Forgotten Reimbursement
Utsav drives three friends to a late-night fast food drive-thru after studying. Since he's driving, it makes sense for him to pay the $42 total bill at the window. His friends verbally agree to send him their portions later—around $10-12 each. Two friends send payment via Venmo within an hour, but one friend forgets. Three days pass before Utsav realizes he's still owed money. He feels awkward texting his friend to remind him about the $12, worried it will seem petty or make their friendship uncomfortable. When he finally sends a reminder text, his friend apologizes and pays immediately, but Utsav wishes there had been a less awkward way to handle the situation without directly confronting his friend about the forgotten payment.
#### Scenario 2: Grocery Run for Shared Apartment Items
Utsav and his two roommates need household supplies including paper towels, dish soap, trash bags, and snacks. Utsav volunteers to make the grocery run and spends $68 at the store. He expects each roommate to contribute roughly $23 for their share. Utsav mentions the purchase to his roommates when he returns but doesn't write down the specific items or amount. A week later, neither roommate has paid him back. Utsav isn't sure if they forgot or if they don't remember agreeing to split the cost. Without a clear record of what was purchased, he struggles to justify asking for reimbursement and feels uncomfortable bringing it up repeatedly. He ends up absorbing part of the cost to avoid making things awkward.
#### Scenario 3: Group Movie Night Snacks and Tickets
Utsav organizes a movie night for five friends, purchasing advance tickets online for $75 total and stopping at the convenience store for candy and drinks costing $32. He keeps mental notes of the expenses, expecting each person to contribute about $21. At the theater, friends thank him for organizing but no one offers payment. After the movie, Utsav casually mentions the costs, and two friends immediately send money via Venmo. The other three say they'll pay later but don't specify when. Days pass without payment, and Utsav feels increasingly uncomfortable asking since he doesn't have clear documentation showing exactly what each person's share includes. Without itemized records, he can't confidently state what they owe, making the reminder conversation feel even more awkward.

3. As someone avoiding awkward conversations, I want to clearly show each person what they ordered and when so that payment requests feel justified rather than confrontational.
4. As a friend who owes money, I want to receive a notification immediately after the purchase so that I don't forget to pay later.

## Interview 4
Interviewee Name: Hayley Bratcher  
Date: October 19, 2025  

**Question 1: Tell me about how you currently manage your personal expenses and any shared expenses with roommates, friends, or groups.**
**Answer:** When going on trips with friends where she pays for everything, Hayley divides expenses evenly between each friend. She primarily uses Venmo for reimbursement, with friends sending her the appropriate amounts through the app.

**Question 2: Walk me through the last time you had to split a bill or shared expense with others. What happened?**
**Answer:** The last time she split a bill, everybody either gave her cash or Venmo'd her the right amount of money. The process was straightforward with people paying their share.

**Question 3: What's the most frustrating or awkward situation you've experienced involving money and other people?**
**Answer:** The most frustrating situation was when it took nearly a year to get her money back from a trip. Specifically mentioned that her boyfriend at the time didn't pay her back for some months after the trip. However, she noted that overall she hasn't really had many frustrating or awkward situations involving money.

**Question 4: How do you keep track of who owes you money or who you owe money to?**
**Answer:** Recently she's been keeping a budget. Every single month she writes a new budget where she writes down each name of people she owes money to, how much she owes them, and the date when she needs to pay them. She acknowledged this system is "very inefficient."

**Question 5: What would make you feel more comfortable asking people to pay you back or reminding them about money they owe?**
**Answer:** For Hayley, the most comfortable approach is being straight up and direct. She's the type of person who doesn't beat around the bush—she would rather be straightforward and explain why she needs the money. She prefers asking people to pay rather than reminding them because "reminding never gets done."

**Question 6: If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about handling expenses, what would it be?**
**Answer:** Saving money would be the one thing she'd fix. She feels it's very hard to save money, especially monthly when there are so many bills to pay. Her biggest problem is trying to save money.

**Question 7 (Optional): How much time per week do you spend dealing with expense-related tasks like tracking spending, paying bills, or settling up with people?**
**Answer:** Hayley spends money every day and deals with expense-related considerations daily. However, she specifically tracks her expenses every Friday. Since she only works Monday through Friday, Friday is her bank day when she calculates all the money she made throughout the week and all the expenses she made throughout the week. This Friday tracking session takes about an hour, including the time to go to the bank and handle everything.

### Persona

**Hayley Bratcher, age 21**, is a waitress at Olive Garden who works Monday through Friday and manages her expenses on a tight budget. She uses Venmo for settling shared expenses with friends and maintains a monthly written budget where she tracks who she owes money to, the amounts, and payment due dates. Hayley describes herself as straightforward and prefers direct communication about money rather than beating around the bush. She reviews her finances every Friday, calculating her weekly earnings and expenses before going to the bank, which takes approximately an hour.

Hayley's primary challenge is saving money while managing numerous monthly bills and daily expenses. She finds her current manual tracking system inefficient, writing down each person's name, amount owed, and due date in a new budget every month. Her biggest frustration with shared expenses occurred when it took nearly a year to get reimbursed for a trip. She values directness when requesting payment, believing that gentle reminders often don't get results. Her ideal solution would help her save money more effectively while streamlining the expense tracking process she currently handles manually each week.

### Scenarios
#### Scenario 1: Year-Long Trip Reimbursement Delay
Hayley organizes a trip with friends and pays for shared expenses upfront, expecting timely reimbursement. She divides costs evenly among participants and sends Venmo requests for each person's share. Most friends pay within weeks, but one person—her boyfriend at the time—delays payment for months. Hayley directly asks for the money multiple times, but gentle reminders don't produce results. Nearly a year passes before she finally receives full reimbursement, creating significant financial strain since she's working on a tight waitress budget. The prolonged delay damages the relationship and leaves Hayley frustrated with her lack of leverage to enforce payment. She wishes she had a system that made delayed payments more visible and provided automated escalating reminders so she didn't have to repeatedly ask.
#### Scenario 2: Weekly Expense Reconciliation on Fridays
Every Friday after her work week ends, Hayley spends about an hour reconciling her finances before going to the bank. She reviews all money earned Monday through Friday and calculates expenses made throughout the week. She updates her monthly budget document, writing down each person she owes money to, the amounts, and due dates. This manual process involves reviewing receipts, checking her bank app, and ensuring all transactions are accounted for. The process is time-consuming and inefficient, requiring her to rewrite everything fresh each month. Hayley finds herself constantly worried about whether she's tracking everything correctly and whether she's forgetting any expenses or people she owes. She wants an automated system that captures expenses throughout the week so her Friday reconciliation takes minutes instead of an hour.
#### Scenario 3: Group Outing with Cash and Venmo Mix
Hayley goes out with friends for dinner and activities. As the organizer, she pays for various shared expenses throughout the evening. When settling up, some friends give her cash while others send Venmo payments for their share of costs. The mixed payment methods create tracking confusion—she has to manually verify that the cash amounts plus Venmo transfers equal what's owed. One friend pays with cash but Hayley forgets to note it, later wondering if that person still owes money. Another friend promises to Venmo "later" but Hayley has no system to track pending payments versus completed ones. Being straightforward by nature, she directly asks friends to pay what they owe, but without clear documentation of who paid what and when, the conversations become awkward even with her direct approach.

1. As someone receiving mixed payment types, I want to log both cash and digital payments in one place so that I have a complete record of who paid.
2. As a user tracking pending payments, I want to distinguish between people who paid immediately versus those who said "later" so that I know who needs follow-up.
3. As someone receiving cash, I want to timestamp when payment was received so that I don't accidentally ask someone twice if I forget they paid.
4. As a direct communicator, I want documented proof of expenses and payment status so that my straightforward requests are backed by clear evidence.
5. As an organizer settling group expenses, I want to see total expected versus total received so that I know immediately if I'm still owed money.

- As a user requesting payment, I want to clearly show each person what they paid for and when so that payment requests feel justified rather than confrontational.
- As someone dealing with disputes, I want to distinguish between verified card transactions and unverified claims so that I can fairly evaluate what was actually spent.
- As someone making shared purchases, I want to automatically capture itemized receipts so that I have documentation when requesting reimbursement later.
### Constraints
Receipt storage requires secure cloud infrastructure with appropriate data retention policies. Image quality of captured receipts must be sufficient for later reference. Data must comply with financial privacy regulations.

## 5. Multi-Payment Method Tracking (Venmo, Cash, Card)
### Description
- As someone receiving mixed payment types, I want to log both cash and digital payments in one place so that I have a complete record of who paid.
- As a user tracking pending payments, I want to distinguish between people who paid immediately versus those who said "later" so that I know who needs follow-up.
- As someone receiving cash, I want to timestamp when payment was received so that I don't accidentally ask someone twice if I forget they paid.
- As Frank's friend, I want to easily be able to pay him back so that there is no hassle.
### Constraints
Integration with payment platforms like Venmo, PayPal, and Zelle requires API partnerships or manual entry options. Cash payments require manual logging with no automated verification capability. Payment status synchronization may have delays.

## 6. Recurring Expense Management (Utilities, Bills)
### Description
- As the bill payer, I want to input the total utility cost so that Knight Wallet can automatically divide it among roommates.
- As a roommate, I want a clear view of the utility charges so I understand what I'm paying for.
- As someone tracking who I owe, I want a running list of people and amounts with due dates so that I don't have to rewrite this information monthly.
- As a roommate, I want to receive a notification when a new bill is added so I can pay on time.
- As a roommate, I want to be able to request adjustments if I was away for part of the month so that payments are fair.
### Constraints
Recurring expense patterns must be user-configurable to account for variable utility costs. Historical data analysis requires sufficient transaction history. Adjustment requests need workflow approval mechanisms to prevent disputes.

## 7. Trip and Event Expense Consolidation
### Description
- As the booker for the trip, I want to track the cost of the rental so that I can split it later.
- As an event organizer, I want to combine multiple related expenses (tickets and snacks) into one group expense so that I can request one total payment per person.
- As someone paying for a group order, I want to automatically log the total amount and split it among participants so that I have a clear record of what each person owes.
- As someone managing group expenses, I want to maintain my own verified transaction history even when others don't participate fully so that my records are always complete.
### Constraints
Event grouping logic must allow flexible date ranges and participant lists. Multi-day trips require expense categorization across different days and activities. Storage requirements increase with detailed trip documentation.
